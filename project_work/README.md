## Knowledge Engineering Project Work

This part of the project compares cadential patterns between Franz Schubert’s Winterreise and The Beatles’ songs from the Isophonics dataset, using a custom ontology for musical cadences. The study highlights distinct cadential usage across the two genres: Schubert’s work shows a preference for Half and Avoided Cadences in minor keys, reflecting the emotional tension typical of Romantic music, while The Beatles’ songs favor Perfect and Plagal Cadences in major keys, aligning with the harmonic clarity of popular music. The results demonstrate how cadence types vary by genre, with classical music emphasizing tension and complexity, and popular music focusing on resolution and structure.
