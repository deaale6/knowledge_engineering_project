## Knowledge Engineering Project

This project presents the development of an ontology and knowledge graph aimed at mod- eling key concepts in musicology, specifically focusing on musical cadences. 
The ontology formalizes the structure and relationships of various cadence types, including Perfect, Im- perfect, Deceptive, Plagal, Half, and Avoided cadences. 
Designed for the analysis of musical compositions, the ontology has been applied to the Winterreise compositions of Franz Schu- bert, utilizing data from the CHOCO dataset.
By mapping chords, degrees, keys, and struc- tural sections of a piece, this ontology enables a detailed examination of cadential patterns and their role in musical form. 
The ontology was visualized using Graffoo in draw.io, and the data was analyzed through a custom Python notebook.
