## Knowledge Engineering Project

This project presents the development of an ontology and knowledge graph aimed at modeling key concepts in musicology, specifically focusing on musical cadences. 
The ontology formalizes the structure and relationships of various cadence types, including Perfect, Imperfect, Deceptive, Plagal, Half, and Avoided cadences. 
Designed for the analysis of musical compositions, the ontology has been applied to the Winterreise compositions of Franz Schu- bert, utilizing data from the CHOCO dataset.
By mapping chords, degrees, keys, and structural sections of a piece, this ontology enables a detailed examination of cadential patterns and their role in musical form. 
The ontology was visualized using Graffoo in draw.io, and the data was analyzed through a custom Python notebook.
